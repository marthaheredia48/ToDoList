**Notes App - Kode with Klossy Mobile App Development Camp 2022**

This project is a Notes app designed as part of the Kode with Klossy Mobile App Development Camp 2022. The app functions as a simple to-do list where users can add tasks and mark them as important or not. It provides a straightforward way to manage and prioritize tasks with visual indicators.

**Features**

-Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list, entering a description for each task.

-Importance Marking:

  --> Each task can be marked as important or not important.
  
  -->Important tasks are highlighted with a distinctive emoji, making them stand out from the less important tasks.
  
-Task Display:

  -->Tasks are displayed in a list format, with important tasks visually differentiated by the emoji.


  -->Users can easily scan the list to see which tasks require more attention.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this app was to create a practical tool for task management, incorporating basic functionality for adding and categorizing tasks. It allowed me to explore user interface design and data management within a mobile app.

**Learning Experience**
Through this project, I gained experience in:

-Creating a User Interface: Designing a list view to display tasks and their importance.

-Implementing Functionality: Adding the ability to mark tasks as important and use visual indicators (emojis) to differentiate them.

-Data Management: Handling task data and maintaining a user-friendly interface for managing and viewing tasks.
